# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

By collecting data for area Public and Charter Schools this analysis can highlight how each type of school is preforming overall. This can be done by looking at measurable statistics each school produces, for example: reading and math scores. By looking at this data we can view trends within each school, each type of school (Public & Charter), and make recommendations based on these findings.

### Discovery

An interesting discovery is that students who attend Charter schools math scores get worse in the time between they begin and graduation with an average score in 9th grade of: 70% and an average score in 12th grade of: 60%. This type of average score drop did not occur in the Public schools. Though their initail (9th grade) average began lower at: 64% the students maintained this score with the 12th grade average of: 64%. While the goal is certainly for students grades to improve as they grow an investigation into why students who attend the Charter Schools are getting worse would be warranted. 

The Charter schools do have a larget budget than the Public schools. While math scores are just one example, further analysis might call into question the idea that a greater budget is equal to a greater education.

### Suggested Analysis

To try and justfiy any budget change requests as well as research into quatlity of education students receive at these schools the following analysis is suggested:
1. Compare the average reading scores in both Charter and Public schools from 9th - 12th grade.

2. Compare average Public School reading and math scores against one another to see if there are any outliers.

    a) Compare the size of the individual schools as well to see if larger student counts equal worse average scores.
  
3. Compare average Charter School reading and math scores against one another to see if there are any outliers.
